Dwifft is meant to be as small as possible. If you want to increase the API surface area, you should have a damn good reason, so please open an issue to talk about it first so that you don't waste your time making a PR that gets closed. The same goes if you want to modify the architecture or overall code structure. In general, I am considerably faster at replying to issues than PRs so if you are contemplating a change, it's never a bad idea to open one and talk about it first before committing more time to it. Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for your help!
